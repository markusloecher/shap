Note:

* Every bullet below provides (first) a direct link to the audio excerpt (on github) as well as a link to the original episode on freakonomics.com with time information
* Until [Airr](https://www.airr.io/) becomes available for Android I am going to have to manually extract passages from podcasts that I really like, sigh.
Maybe the required substantial manual work acts as a filter for not overloading this page.

### People I (Mostly) Admire

* [Kerwin Charles on Public Speaking](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-2021-01-02-15h08m18s-Kerwin Charles_ “One Does Not Know Where an Insight Will Come From”-.mp3)  
(https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-kerwin-charles/ 05:45-07:27)

The following semi serious quotes are from a bonus episode introducing the new podcast [People I (Mostly) Admire](https://freakonomics.com/pima/) which can  actually be [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbGMWZYuCt4&feature=youtu.be) instead of just listened to.

* Steven Levitt on 
  * [avoiding time commitments :)](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-Steve Levitt_I'm Not as Childlike as I'd Like to Be-0125-0156.mp3)

I actually do not agree with this extremely oversimplified -borderline pretentious- view whose main purpose seems to want to support Levitt's "iconoclastic" status; but I like it as a thought provoking exercise.
